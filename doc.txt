Start in Block Class contain:
    1- timestamp : time of creation the block.
    2- transaction
    3- previousHash: hash of previous block.
    4- nonce: used in PoW. 

the blockChain keep the blocks and also contain method to add new block to the chain and
one to check if the chain is correct by test the hash of preBlock and the current hash if it's correct


    proof-of-work used to confirm the transaction and creates a new block to the chain.
but this operation need a high performance to done but still possioble.
